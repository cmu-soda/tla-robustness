TLA+ Module Comparison: NaiveProtocol v. ABPProtocol
The robustness of the two specs are incomparable

Robustness comparison: eta(NaiveProtocol) - eta(ABPProtocol)
Diff rep grouped by action:

GetAck0:
Safety boundary representation: out/NaiveProtocol_GetAck0_diff_rep.txt
Safety boundary rep formula (with sort definitions):
Sort2 == {"Kevin","David","Ian"}
/\ senderState = "send"
/\ senderBit = 0
/\ receiverState = "output"
/\ \A S \in Sort2 : (output # S \/ input # S)
